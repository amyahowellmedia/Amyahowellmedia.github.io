			<h1> From Grit-and-Grind to Analytics-Driven: How the Celtics Reinvented Winning </h1>
			<h2> Using two decades of Boston Celtics data — from the Paul Pierce–Kevin Garnett years to the Jayson Tatum–Jaylen Brown era — this project tracks how shifts in coaching, pace, and offensive and defensive efficiency transformed the team from a defense-first group under Doc Rivers into a faster, analytics-driven contender under Joe Mazzulla, revealing how one franchise’s evolution mirrors the modern NBA.</h2>
			<h4>Amya Howell </h4>
		</section>Over the past two decades, the Boston Celtics have made a generational change. This NBA team has transformed from a slow, defense-first team built around veterans such as Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett into one of the NBA’s fastest, most analytics-drivn offenses led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. I dove deep into the analysis of the past 20 years of team statistics. When looking at the offensive rating to pace win percentage, I was able to see how dramatically the Celtics’ identity has shifted. There is a clear timeline of how coaching changes, roster moves, and evolving league trends pushed Boston from grit-and-grind basketball to the modern, high-efficiency style that defines the franchise today. 
There are three clear trends that I want to highlight when looking at Boston’s evolution. First and foremost, Boston shifted from one of the league's slowest, most defensive-minded squads to a faster, more efficient offense who is built around pace and spacing. Second, the Celtics’ offensive rating climbed sharply in the Tatum-Brown era, reflecting a move toward analytics-driven shot selectiona nd higher scoring output. And third, despite stylistic changes, the team’s overall win percentage improved most consistently under coaches who balanced efficiency with strong defensive schemes, showing that Boston’s success still hinges on blending modern offense with the franchise’s defensive roots. Together, these findings show how the Celtics’ identity didnt just change, but it adapted to the demands of a new NBA.
The easiest way to break these eras down is by coaches. There have been 3 coaches who have led the Celtics in the past decade. Doc Rivers was the Coach from 2004 to 2013. Following Rivers, Brad Stevens who was the head coach from 2013-2021. Joe Mazzula took his place after and is now the current coach. These 3 eras reflect different styles of play and success, and we are here to analyze the data to see why.
<h3>From Defense to Efficiency: How the Celtics’ Style Changed</h3>

		</section>The Boston Celtics today operate as one of the league’s most analytically optimized offenses, but two decades ago, they relied on a much different identity. In the mid-2000s and early 2010s, Boston played slow, physical, half-court basketball built around veterans and elite defensive rotations. Their pace numbers were consistently among the league’s lowest, and their offensive rating hovered around the middle of the pack.
That trend began shifting around 2014 under Brad Stevens, when the Celtics slowly increased pace, threes, and spacing. The real leap came during the Tatum-Brown era. From 2017 onward, Boston’s offensive rating rises sharply in the data, eventually becoming one of the best in the league. Under Joe Mazzulla, this shift fully crystallized: the Celtics now consistently attempt one of the NBA’s highest volumes of three-pointers, and their offensive rating reached franchise-record highs in his first two seasons.
This transformation didn’t happen overnight, but it unfolded through three distinct coaching philosophies.


		<section>
			<h3>How Coaching Philosophy Drove Their Evolution</h4>

		<section>
		</p>	
During the Doc Rivers era, the Celtics built their identity around toughness, veteran leadership, and elite defensive execution. The data shows that Boston played at its slowest pace of the entire 20-year window during these seasons and relied heavily on half-court offense and mid-range scoring. Their defensive rating consistently ranked among the league’s best, especially during their championship years. Reflecting this mindset after a 2010 playoff game, Rivers said, “It was a defensive game. We like those,” when asked about his team’s effort on that end of the floor in a post game interview with Boston.com. Boston’s win percentage peaked when their defense was inside the top five, which reinforces the idea that their success depended on controlling tempo and stopping opponents rather than outrunning them.
Brad Stevens Era (2013–2021): The Modern Transition:
When Brad Stevens became head coach, he inherited a roster in transition, but his approach aligned with the direction of the modern NBA. Beginning around 2015, the Celtics’ pace began rising steadily, marking one of the first major shifts away from Rivers’ slower style. Stevens said, “for us, pace is the word. Pace can be up the floor, but it can also be when you get into the half court, being able to move and cut and play together.” The team also increased its emphasis on spacing, ball movement, and efficient shot selection. Year after year, mid-range attempts declined, while three-point attempts and drives to the basket became more common. The offensive rating improved sharply once the Tatum and Brown era began, which signaled a move toward a more efficient and adaptable offense. Stevens did not transform Boston into a fully high-speed team, but he laid the foundation for a more analytic and modern system that shaped the next stage of the franchise.
Joe Mazzulla Era (2021–Present): Analytics Fully Take Over:
Joe Mazzulla represents the point where the Celtics completely embraced an analytics-based identity. The data shows that his teams have the highest offensive rating within the full 20-year span. Boston now plays with a faster pace than either previous coaching era, and the team attempts one of the highest volumes of three-pointers in the league. Mazzulla’s philosophy focuses on spacing, decision-making, and maximizing expected points per possession. Under his leadership, the Celtics have fully committed to a style of play built on efficiency, intentional floor spacing, and quick, purposeful shots. Mazzulla also emphasizes lineup versatility as a key part of that efficiency. In a 2023 interview, he described his roster flexibility by saying, “Ever seen ‘Spider-Man’? ‘Into the Spider-Verse’? There’s like, 20 different Spider-Men. That’s like our team.” This approach allows Boston to deploy multiple lineup combinations without sacrificing spacing or shot quality, which helps sustain a high offensive rating even as rotations change throughout a game or season.

			</p>The win percentage data reinforces that Boston’s stylistic evolution did not come at the expense of success. While the Celtics played at slower tempos under Doc Rivers and gradually increased pace under Brad Stevens, winning remained strong across both eras. The most recent data shows that Joe Mazzulla’s fast, efficiency-driven system has coincided with the highest average win percentage of the three coaching tenures. Taken together, the two visualizations show that Boston did not abandon its identity to chase modern trends. Instead, the franchise adapted its approach, using pace, spacing, and lineup versatility to meet the demands of a new NBA while preserving the winning standards that have defined the Celtics for decades.

			<h3 class="glow-hover">Winning Through Adaptation, Not Reinvention</h3>
			</p>
			Over the past two decades, the Boston Celtics have shown that evolution does not require abandoning identity. The data reveals a franchise that adapted strategically to the modern NBA by increasing pace, spacing, and offensive efficiency, while still maintaining a foundation built on discipline and defense. From Doc Rivers’ slow, defense-first teams to Brad Stevens’ transitional era and Joe Mazzulla’s analytics-driven system, Boston’s success has remained remarkably consistent. That balance helps explain why the Celtics’ most recent dominance feels almost inevitable. As ESPN’s Scott Van Pelt described the 2024 championship Celtics, they were “boring in the best way,” a team so efficient and controlled that excellence became routine. Ultimately, the Celtics’ story is not just about playing faster or scoring more, but about using data to win sustainably in every era.</p>
